# Responsive-Portfolio
In this homework I added three types of '@media screen' tags to my CSS page and the 'viewpont' tag to all html pages. 

Here is a screenshot of added code:

Also, I downloaded Chrome extensions Window Resizer and Browser Width in order to view changes of the layout of my website with different screen sizes. 

The most challanging part of this work was figuring out how to place my name on the entire screen (640px) and navigation bar right under it. 

I look forward to hearing your feedback.
